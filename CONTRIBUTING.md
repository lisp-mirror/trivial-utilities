# Contributing to trivial-utilities

In my daily work I only use SBCL and CCL, and mostly under linux. Occasionaly I also run things on a Windows machine. So feel free to fork this project and add support for other compilers and platforms.

Although I now develop for many years with Common Lisp, I'm still learning - and will hopefully never stop. So if you would like to show me how to improve the code, please feel free to fork or send me a message.

If you open a Pull Request, others will also benefit from your work.
